# Paper §6, "Instances Across the Literature" (`sections/instances.tex`)

Statement layer for Section `sec:instances`.  Read it side by side with
`sections/instances.tex`: the `/-! ## … -/` headers follow the paper's
subsections, entries appear in paper order, and each entry quotes the claim
it formalizes.

* Numbered results and displayed equations are named by their LaTeX label
  (`«prop:iconfluence-lm»`, …).
* Unlabeled claims are named `«<enclosing label>/<slug>»`, e.g.
  `«sec:hat-instance/serializability-cycle»`.
* Every proof is a pointer to the library (`Instances/Examples.lean`,
  `Instances/QueryRefinements.lean`, `Instances/InvariantConfluence.lean`,
  `Instances/BailisDefinition.lean`).

Conventions shared by the entries (details in `Instances/Examples.lean`):
finite payload sets are `Inst.FSet P` (inclusion); a join-semilattice is
`Inst.JSL D`; the CRDT state `s(U) = s₀ ⊔ ⨆U` is `Inst.st s₀ U`; a function
`f` is read as the specification `Comp.graph f`; `Comp.Monotone f` is
`∀ x y, x ≼ y → f x ≼ f y`; the Boolean order `false ≼ true` is `Prop` under
implication; fact sets and database states are `IConf.St X := X → Prop`,
ordered by inclusion.  Finite families of rows are lists.

The invariant-confluence model and its proof are spelled out in
`Paper/AppB_InvariantConfluence.lean`.

/-! The opening paragraph ("Complete CALM provides a unified lens for many
results across literatures.  Each setting below declares an input, an output,
and their orders before applying either theorem.") frames the section; it
states no claim of its own.

## Query monotonicity (`sec:query-instance`)

The first paragraph recalls the relational-transducer CALM Theorem ("the CALM
Theorem of Ameloot et al. proves an operational result for relational
languages on transducer networks: coordination-free evaluation is possible
iff a program is monotone … Functional CALM does not replace the details of
that theorem.  It abstracts the result to a property that can be compared
with specifications outside Datalog.").  The abstraction is
`«eq:query-monotonicity»` (§2); the transducer theorem itself is cited, not
formalized.  The entries below check the mapping of its refinements into our
frame (`Instances/QueryRefinements.lean`); the operational statements of
those papers (placement policies, transducers, which orders their placement
models justify) are cited, not formalized. -/

/-- Sec. `sec:query-instance`: "A query is domain-distinct-monotone when
`Q(I) ⊆ Q(I ∪ J)` for every `J` whose facts each contain a value that does
not occur in `I`.  It is domain-disjoint-monotone when this holds for every
`J` whose facts use only such values.  Each is Functional CALM under a
different input order. … When the order lets `I ∪ J` expand `I` only for such
`J`, each condition is functional monotonicity."  Lean: facts carry values
`vals : F → V → Prop`; `ExtInp (distinctAdm vals)` and
`ExtInp (disjointAdm vals)` order instances by domain-distinct and
domain-disjoint expansion (nullary facts are never domain disjoint, as in
Ameloot et al.).  For each order, the weaker monotonicity is monotonicity of
`J ↦ Q(J)`, and by Functional CALM the graph is consistent exactly when it
holds.  With every fact admissible the order is inclusion and the condition
is ordinary query monotonicity. -/

/-- Sec. `sec:query-instance`: "Ameloot et al. characterized the new classes
by weaker forms of monotonicity, correcting an earlier one-fact version."
Lean: the one-fact domain-distinct test is strictly weaker.  The query "the
edge relation has no 2-cycle" passes it, but adding the domain-disjoint
instance `{e(0,1), e(1,0)}` to `∅` falsifies the query, so it is neither
domain-disjoint- nor domain-distinct-monotone. -/

/-- Sec. `sec:query-instance`: "With outputs ordered by inclusion, and an
input expanding another when it adds facts only at new nodes, a behavior is a
relational specification.  Their characterization uses node monotonicity:
outputs computed by two disjoint subnetworks have a common refinement at the
merged network.  Lifted Monotonicity implies it."  Lean: inputs are
`ExtInp (netAdm loc)` (located facts, network expansion) and a behavior is any
`Spec` on them; consistency, equivalently Lifted Monotonicity, implies
`NodeMono`. -/

/-- Sec. `sec:query-instance`: "The converse fails … A subnetwork may still
choose among outputs … Complete CALM counts that choice as a commitment …, so
it requires directed fibers, and node monotonicity does not."  Lean (a
smaller choice than a spanning tree): each node of the input may pick one
Boolean.  Disjoint networks never pick at the same node, so the behavior is
node monotone; at the one-node network the picks `true` and `false` have no
common refinement, so the fiber is not directed and the behavior is not
consistent.  (Their notion of coordination, computing without the list of all
nodes, is cited, not formalized.) -/

coincide."  Lean: for the graph of `b`, node monotonicity is monotonicity
under network expansion, which by Functional CALM is consistency. -/

/-! ## CRDTs: monotone queries over convergent state (`sec:crdt-instance`)

The opening paragraph ("A CRDT guarantees that replicas receiving the same
updates converge to equivalent states … But the Strong Eventual Consistency
property it offers provides no guarantee on what the environment may observe,
and is subject to Lamport's "anomalous behavior" (§`sec:coordination`).
Laddad et al. proposed monotonicity as the right test for safe observation
from CRDT state.") cites rather than proves; its two-phase-set example is
checked in `«sec:crdt-instance/two-phase»` below. -/

/-- Sec. `sec:crdt-instance`: "the replica's state is `s(U) = s₀ ⊔ ⨆U`."

`q` need only be monotone between reachable states."  Lean:
(1) sufficient; (2) `q ∘ s` is monotone iff `q` is monotone between reachable
states `s(U) ⊑ s(V)`; (3) not required: on the two-point lattice with
`s₀ = tt`, negation is not monotone but `neg ∘ s` is. -/

/-- Sec. `sec:crdt-instance`: a two-phase set's "state `(Add, Del)` merges by
componentwise union.  The query `Add \ Del` can report a Ferrari in a shopping
cart before a delayed removal arrives … The two-phase query fails the test: a
removal payload grows `U` and shrinks the answer."  Lean: payloads are pairs
`(Add, Del)` joined componentwise, `s₀ = (∅, ∅)`; with
`s(U₀) = ({potato, Ferrari}, ∅)` and `s(U₁) = ({potato, Ferrari}, {Ferrari})`,
`U₀ ⊆ U₁` but `q_2P(s(U₀)) = {potato, Ferrari} ⋠ {potato} = q_2P(s(U₁))`, so
`q_2P ∘ s` is not consistent, while the state specification `s` is. -/

/-! ## Highly available transactions (`sec:hat-instance`)

The opening paragraph (inputs are request sets, outputs are fact sets, both
under inclusion; the isolation level fixes the specification) is the model of
`Inst.factSpec allowed P`: at input `i` expose any fact set `F ⊆ allowed i`
satisfying the isolation predicate `P`.  Its remarks on the response
obligation and on sticky availability as a deployment are pointers to
App. `app:cap-response` and Prop. `thm:complete-cap-deployment`, not claims
proved here. -/

/-- Paragraph "Accumulating facts": one replica exposes
`read(T₁,x,0), commit(T₁)`, the other `read(T₂,y,0), commit(T₂)`; "the union
contains no dirty read.  Under the stated read-committed specification …
later delivery keeps all four facts."  Lean: each side and their union are
read committed, and the read-committed specification satisfies Lifted
Monotonicity and is consistent for any monotone `allowed`. -/

/-- Paragraph "Serializability and transaction ordering": `T₁` reads `x = 0`,
writes `y = 1`, commits; `T₂` reads `y = 0`, writes `x = 1`, commits.  "The
serialization graph contains a cycle, so no serial order of `T₁` and `T₂`
explains both sets of facts."  Lean: each side is serializable; no fact set
containing both sides (and supported by the requests) is serializable; hence
the serializable specification violates Lifted Monotonicity and is not
consistent. -/

under union … has a common outcome for whatever separated replicas expose,
so it stays available.  One that orders or excludes concurrent transactions …
rules out combinations that separated replicas can each expose."  Lean:
(1) for any isolation predicate `P` closed under union, the fact-set
specification satisfies Lifted Monotonicity; (2) two rows below a common
input `j` with no permitted common upper bound at `j` refute Lifted
Monotonicity and consistency.  (Availability then follows from
Thm. `thm:complete-cap`; that emitting either side requires a choice is

one-creation histories, but its state has two employees with ID 7, so no
state it permits refines both."  Lean (library names from an earlier
username version of the example): versions are the employees holding ID 7;
`alloc a` creates employee `a` with ID 7 if the replica sees the ID unused;
the invariant `uModel.Inv` is "at most one employee has ID 7"; `jU` has the
unordered events `alloc 1`, `alloc 2`; `oneU n t` is the one-event history.

/-- "Concurrency, not the transactions alone, decides the outcome: a
transaction that is harmless after another can, when it runs without seeing
it, produce a state whose merge with the other's is invalid."  Lean:
`alloc 2` after `alloc 1` is valid, `alloc 2` alone is valid, but the merge of
`alloc 1` and `alloc 2` run concurrently from `s₀` is invalid. -/
